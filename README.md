## My process
Every layout was centered around flexboxes. 
Here is the tree layout:

App\
|\
|-> Top\
| |\
| |-> Navigation\
|\
|-> Middle\
| |\
| |-> Main Heading\
| |\
| |-> Side Sub Heading\
|\
|-> Bottom\
| |\
| |-> Bottom Sub Heading\

My initial thought for using this method was ease of spacing.
However I have learned that there are significantly better
CSS layouts.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to use the ReactJS library by creating
components and using properties.

### Continued development

I plan on creating more fleshed-out websites, but this 
was a fun challenge to test my current frontend development
skills, as well as an opportunity to learn more about 
ReactJS.
